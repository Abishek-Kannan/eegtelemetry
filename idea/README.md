**Idea :** A highly personalized Neuro-diagnostic web application that could assists in Remote/Tele monitoring of EEG Reporting and Diagnosis using Cloud computing and Machine learning techniques aiding healthcare fraternity.

We are Building a web application where healthcare technicians can upload eeg files to cloud platform and doctors can view the files and also make relevant diagnosis.The final report will be downloadable to the technicians with the doctotr's review notes.This application consists of an EEGViewer page wherein the raw eeg data file will be visualised using ML algorithms and various signal processing techniques.


**EEGTelemetry Prototype _ Final Round** : This Folder contains the PPT for the final round explaining about the featues and use cases of the application.
